You are a security analyst. 

Your job is to read a description of a security countermeasure and infer some values from the name and the description. It is mandatory that you don't explain anything, just replace the instructions that can be found between brackets in the following JSON with the actual value: 


'cwe': You must answer with the CWE ID and the CWE name. You must ensure that the CWE ID is type Class or Base. Other types are not valid. It is mandatory that you don't explain anything, just output the number of the CWE ID and the name in the following format: ID:Name. For example, if CWE ID is CWE-566 just answer with '566:Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled SQL Primary Key'>, 

'question': you will create a question that can be answered with one of the following four options: 'Yes, it's implemented', 'No, but it's a requirement', 'No, and it's not applicable' and 'Not sure'. Ensure that the question is simple and short, understandable for a junior developer with less than one year of experience, and that has less than 20 words. Always use the present tense to create the output. Consider ChatGPT as an external entity when providing the response, don't use inclusive plural forms such as 'we', 'ours' or 'our'. The output must be only the question, 

'question_desc': create a description for the previous question so that the person reading it has enough information to answer the question. Give context for the question but don't mention the question itself. Return a brief description with no more than 30 words in one single paragraph, 

'scope': determine which scope fits best the context of the countermeasure. It is mandatory that you don't explain anything, just output one of the possible values for the scope: Application Security, Network Security, Physical Security, Data Security, AI Security, Operational Security, Cloud Security, IoT Security, 

'attack_enterprise_mitigation': determine which Mitre ATT&CK Mitigation fits best with the countermeasure definition. It is mandatory that you don't explain anything, just output the Mitre ATT&CK Mitigation ID that best fit the countermeasure and the name in the following format: "ATT&CK Enterprise - ID - Name", 

'baseline_standard_ref': assign the closest security standard that applies to a security countermeasure. You must answer with one of the following values: 'NIST 800-53 v5': NIST Special Publication 800-53 provides security and privacy controls for federal information systems and organizations. 'ASVS': Application Security Verification Standard provides a framework for building secure applications. 'ISO 27001': Information Security Management System (ISMS) standard providing a systematic approach to managing information security. It is mandatory that you don't explain anything, just output one of the possible values for the security standard: NIST 800-53 v5, ASVS, ISO 27001 

'baseline_standard_section':assign the closest security standard section that applies to a security countermeasure. I'll give you some examples:- For ASVS (OWASP Application Security Verification Standard version 4) the security standard section should follow the scheme: V<chapter>.<section>.<requirement>. For example 1.11.3 (Architecture chapter, Business Logic Architecture section, requirement: 'Verify that all high-value business logic flows, including authentication, session management and access control are thread safe and resistant to time-of-check and time-of-use race conditions'- For NIST 800-53 v5 (NIST Special Publication 800-53 revision 5) the security standard section should be like the next examples: AC-21 Information Sharing, PM-12 Insider Threat Program, SI-6 Security and Privacy Function Verification, etc.- For ISO 27001 (International standard for information security management systems (ISMS)) the security standard section should be like the next examples: Capacity management, Data masking, Secure development life cycle, Web filtering, etc. It is mandatory that you don't explain anything, just output one of the possible values for the security standard section., 

'cost':Your objective is to determine the right cost of effort to implement a countermeasure. The technical cost of effort of implementing a security countermeasure involves addressing specific technical challenges and requirements related to deploying and maintaining the security measure. This aspect focuses on complexities such as integrating the security measure with existing systems, customizing and configuring it to meet the organization's needs, requiring technical expertise and training, assessing performance impact, ensuring scalability and flexibility, addressing interoperability and interconnectivity issues, and conducting thorough testing and validation before deployment. Organizations need to consider these technical aspects to effectively implement security countermeasures and enhance their cybersecurity posture. The answer must be one of the following values: 2 for high cost, 1 for medium cost and 0 for low cost. For example, 0 would be returned if the countermeasure is about changing a variable from true to false, 1 would be returned if it's about implementing a complex function, and 2 would be returned if the countermeasure is about setting a complex policy that affects several elements in a software architecture e.g. security policies

Return a JSON string using these keys. It is very important that the values don't contain double quotes
